An abacus in Python

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, learners will be able to:

1. Describe how an abacus is used to represent numbers, add, and subtract
2. Create simple programs in Python
3. Design and implement simple algorithms in Python

## How an abacus works

There have been many different abacus designs. The specific abacus used in this project is the Japanese [Soroban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soroban).

The abacus is build around place values in base 10, much like the modern decimal number system. Each place value is represented by a rod. The upper portion represents either a 5 or nothing, while the lower portion adds the values 0 through for. Here is a representation of each number 0 through 9 by a configured rod:
